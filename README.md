# My JSON Resume

I think the notion of a [standardized resume template](https://github.com/jsonresume/) is beautiful and wanted to follow suit.

This repository contains my actual resume in JSON format, along with a quick 'n' dirty tool to help me ensure it conforms to the schema while I write it.

## Getting Started

```
npm run build
npm run start
```

or just

```
npm run start-dev
```

to launch `nodemon`.
